    <h3>Why I Chose Programming</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><b>I've been a nerd my whole life</b>, from Star Wars and Star Trek to video games. Probably my most nerdy characteristic comes from the time I spent in the Navy. I scored the top of my class and got orders as an Avionics Electronics Technician on the P3-Orion platform. They called us, <strong>"Trons"</strong> because we worked on everything that nobody else in the squadron could really understand; we worked in a digital and technological environment. It was a prestigious position and we got away with a lot of stuff because of it.</p>
    <p>After getting out of the Navy, I joined the family Real Estate business. <i>I gave it my best shot for three years</i> before I just couldn't handle it anymore. Nobody wants a young guy representing them in a real estate transaction; I simply didn't have enough grey hairs. I also learned that I don't really like dealing directly with people and their drama/emotions, that type of stress can really take a toll on someone's sanity. Those three years weren't a complete waste though! It lead me into the world of computer programming. I work way better with systems and logic than I do with people, and that isn't to say that I don't enjoy working with people in order to achieve a common goal! I just enjoy the focus of the position, as a programmer, to write, maintain, organize, and optimize software systems.

    <h3>What I Expect From This Class</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        After the six months of this Full Stack course is complete, I am hoping to have a much better understanding of how Full Stack development works. I look at it as a jumping-off point that I can take and expand upon. I am really hoping to get a coding job shortly after this class is accomplished so I can start a family with my Wife, Brooke.
